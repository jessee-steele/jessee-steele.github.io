Hi there! I'm a first-year Ph.D. student at the University of Virginia working on questions in ecosystem ecology and ecophysiology with Dr. Xi Yang. I'm currently interested in understanding the extent and cause of tree mortality in the Western United States.

Previously, I worked on environmental regulation and compliance with Eastern Research Group, Inc. for federal and state agencies. I completed my undergraduate at Duke University, where I worked with Dr. Emily Bernhardt to understand how headwater streams are changing. 

In my free time, I love to host dinner parties, powerlift, and rescue dying plants!
