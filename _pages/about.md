Hi there! I'm a first-year Ph.D. student at the University of Virginia working on questions in ecosystem ecology and ecophysiology with Dr. Xi Yang in the Environmental Sciences department.

Previously, I worked on environmental regulation and compliance with Eastern Research Group, Inc. for federal and state agencies. I completed my undergraduate at Duke University, where I worked with Dr. Emily Bernhardt to understand how headwater streams are changing. 

In my free time, I love to cook, powerlift, garden, and craft.
